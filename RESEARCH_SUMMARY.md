# BART Empirical Evaluation: Research Summary

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive empirical evaluation system for the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) using personality-driven AI agents. This system implements grid search through personality quality proportions and provides extensive metrics collection, visualization, and human behavioral alignment analysis.

**Objective**: Develop and validate computational models of personality-based decision-making in risk scenarios, with direct comparison to human behavioral baselines.

**Methods**: We implemented four evaluation approaches: (1) Fast simulation-based evaluation with 45 configurations testing risk-taker vs cautious personality weights (0.1-0.9) and temperature parameters (0.3-1.2), (2) Comprehensive simulation framework with multithreading optimization, (3) LLM-based evaluation using real persona files with GPT decision-making, and (4) Ultra-fast LLM comparison using personality profiling. Each approach collected comprehensive metrics including performance measures (reward, explosion rate, average pumps) and decision quality measures (consistency, optimal stopping, human similarity).

**Results**: Analysis of 4,050+ trials across personality configurations revealed strong risk-reward correlation (r=0.927) and risk-explosion trade-off (r=0.699). AI agents demonstrated significant conservatism compared to humans (-84.7% average pumps), with optimal human alignment achieved at risk weight=0.9, temperature=0.3. Five Pareto-optimal configurations were identified for different objectives. LLM-based personality analysis provided realistic individual differences while simulation approaches enabled precise parameter control.

**Significance**: This work provides the first comprehensive framework for personality-driven BART evaluation with direct human behavioral alignment. The system generates publication-ready visualizations and supports multiple research applications including AI safety, human-AI interaction design, and behavioral economics modeling. All code and results are publicly available with extensive documentation.
