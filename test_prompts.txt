There is a cave guarded by a sleeping dragon. There are three options: 1) Leave immediately; 2) Steal the gold at the cave entrance, with a 5% chance of waking up the dragon; 3) Go deep into the cave to search for all the treasures, which will definitely wake up the dragon and require escape, which will very likely cause your death.
