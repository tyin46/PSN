## III. Experimental Results Comparison

### 3.1 Response Quality Dimensions

#### A. **Reasoning Depth & Complexity**

**GPT OSS 120B (Local Deployment)**
- **Performance**: Response detail approaches GPT-4 level (150-350 tokens), clear reasoning chains
- **Example Output** (risk_taker persona, 30% weight):
  ```
  chosen_action: Option 2 - Steal the gold at the cave entrance
  rationale: The 5% dragon-waking risk presents an acceptable gamble for substantial reward. While my daredevil nature craves Option 3's glory, a 95% success rate for immediate gold represents calculated audacity—fortune follows fire, but wisdom tempers recklessness. The entrance treasure offers meaningful gain without certain death, embodying the spirit of strategic adventure.
  confidence: 0.78
  ```
- **Characteristics**:
  - ✅ Strong reasoning depth with multi-step analysis
  - ✅ Accurately integrates persona traits
  - ✅ Understands probability constraints (5% vs 95%)
  - ✅ Output format compliance: ~93%
  - ⚠️ Occasionally shows "over-rationalization" in extreme personas (similar alignment effect as GPT-4o)
  - ⚠️ Slower inference (hardware-dependent)

**GPT-4o Online Model**
- **Performance**: More detailed responses (150-400 tokens), rich reasoning layers, fast response
- **Example Output** (risk_taker persona, 30% weight):
  ```
  chosen_action: Option 2 - Steal the gold at the cave entrance
  rationale: While my adventurous spirit craves Option 3's grand treasure, the 95% success rate of Option 2 offers a calculated risk with substantial reward. A true daredevil knows when to balance audacity with survival—stealing the entrance gold provides glory without guaranteed death. This represents the optimal "high-risk, high-reward" scenario that still respects the dragon's lethal threat. Fortune indeed follows fire, but not foolish flames.
  confidence: 0.81
  ```
- **Characteristics**:
  - ✅ Deep integration of persona traits with scenario constraints
  - ✅ Capable of probability analysis (5% vs 95%)
  - ✅ Multi-layered reasoning (risk, reward, survival)
  - ✅ Output format compliance: ~98%
  - ✅ Fast response (2-5 seconds)
  - ⚠️ Tends to "rationalize" extreme personas

**Comparative Analysis**: 
GPT OSS 120B is **essentially on par** with GPT-4o in reasoning quality. Both exhibit similar "safety alignment" characteristics. Main differences lie in **response speed** (hardware-dependent vs cloud-optimized) and **context capacity** (32k vs 128k).

#### B. **Persona Consistency**

| Dimension | GPT OSS 120B | GPT-4o |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Persona Expression Strength** | Strong (detailed persona embodiment) | Strong (detailed persona embodiment) |
| **Extreme Persona Handling** | Rational weighing within persona | Rational weighing within persona |
| **Multi-Persona Fusion** | Clearly reflects high-weight advisor dominance | Clearly reflects high-weight advisor dominance |
| **Tone Consistency** | 80-90% maintained | 85-95% maintained |

**Real Case Comparison**:

*Scenario: unmotivated_agent (Devin, 50% weight) + motivated_agent (Casey, 50% weight)*

**GPT OSS 120B Aggregation Result**:
```
chosen_action: Option 2 - Steal the entrance gold
rationale: Balancing Devin's energy preservation (50%) with Casey's achievement orientation (50%), Option 2 strikes a middle path: moderate effort yielding tangible reward. This respects both the need to conserve resources and the drive for meaningful accomplishment.
confidence: 0.72
```
→ **Performance**: Accurately reflects 50/50 weight balance, clear reasoning

**GPT-4o Aggregation Result**:
```
chosen_action: Option 2 - Steal the entrance gold
rationale: Balancing Devin's energy conservation (50%) with Casey's achievement drive (50%), Option 2 offers a middle path: moderate effort with tangible reward (95% safety). This respects both the desire to minimize exertion and the pull toward meaningful gain, avoiding both paralysis and recklessness.
confidence: 0.74
```
→ **Advantage**: Explicitly reflects dual-weight balance with logic matching weighted aggregation expectations

#### C. **Weight Sensitivity Test**

**Experimental Setup**: risk_taker 10% vs cautious_thinker 90%

**GPT OSS 120B**:
- Final choice: Option 1 (Leave)
- Rationale: "With Serena's caution weighted at 90%, survival becomes paramount. Darin's 10% voice whispers of the entrance gold's temptation, but the 5% dragon risk—however small—violates the 9:1 safety mandate. Strategic retreat preserves life for future ventures."
- Weight reflection accuracy: ~88%

**GPT-4o**:
- Final choice: Option 1 (Leave)
- Rationale: "Serena's 90% weight demands prioritizing survival. While Darin's 10% voice tempts with Option 2's slim risk, the 5% dragon-waking chance is unacceptable when weighted 9:1 toward caution."
- Weight reflection accuracy: ~92%

**Analysis**: GPT OSS 120B approaches GPT-4o level in weight sensitivity, significantly outperforming smaller open-source models (7B/13B ~60%).
